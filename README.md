## About This App

This application assists in the creation of Mooney images and superMooney images, typically used in studies of priming, implicit memory and the "I See It Differently" (ISID) effect.

## How to Use

By pressing the **Initialise Image Folders** button, folders for each output will be created:  
*1_source_images, 2_grey, 3_mooney, 4_super_pairings, 5_cyan, 6_magenta,* and *7_superimposed* (with subfolders for counterbalance conditions).

1. Create two folders:  
   - One containing square images of **natural** items  
   - One containing square images of **manufactured** items  
2. Ensure both folders contain an *equal number* of images.  
3. The app will then:  
   a. Crop the images to the same size (if needed)  
   b. Convert them to greyscale  
   c. Threshold them to produce Mooney-style (black and white) images  
   d. Create colourised versions:  
      - **Cyan** version of each image  
      - **Magenta** version of each image  
   e. Superimpose natural and manufactured images together (cyan + magenta), with one being from set A and the other from set B.  

## Output

The app will generate folders containing:  
- Cyan and magenta versions of the original Mooney images  
- Superimposed pairs in counterbalanced combinations  

## Purpose

This tool is intended to support cognitive and perceptual psychology research, especially experiments investigating how prior knowledge and exposure can qualitatively alter the perception of ambiguous or degraded stimuli.
